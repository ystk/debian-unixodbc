unixodbc (2.2.14p2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Multiarch directory added to search path

    In order to support installation of ODBC drivers for multiple
    architectures at once and to enable architecture-neutral odbcinst.ini to
    locate these drivers, libodbc now adds /usr/lib/$arch/odbc to its
    internal search path.  Drivers installed to this directory can be
    referred to with a relative filename in odbcinst.ini, and libodbc will
    automatically look in the correct library for this architecture.

    Drivers using such relative paths in their odbcinst.ini settings should
    declare Breaks: unixodbc (<< 2.2.14p2-3), odbcinst1debian2 (<<
    2.2.14p2-3), libiodbc2.  (This logic may be implemented in libiodbc2 at
    a later date.)
